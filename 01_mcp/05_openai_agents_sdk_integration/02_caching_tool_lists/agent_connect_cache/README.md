## 🔁 Full Flow (Behind the Scenes)

### 1. **Startup / Initialization**

* `.env` is loaded
* Gemini client (`AsyncOpenAI`) is created
* `MCPServerStreamableHttp` is created and entered (`__aenter__`)
* `connect()` is called:

  * Sets up a streamable HTTP connection
  * Sends `initialize()` to the MCP server (check server logs!)
  * Connection is now alive

---

### 2. **Agent Setup**

```python
assistant = Agent(...)
```

At this point:

* Gemini is the model backing the agent
* MCP server is connected and ready
* Agent is aware it *can* call tools but hasn't tried yet

---

### 3. **Prompt Execution Begins**

```python
result = await Runner.run(assistant, "What is Sir Zia mood?")
```

### This kicks off the full pipeline:

---

#### ✅ Step 1: Agent calls Gemini

It sends a prompt like:

```
User: What is Sir Zia mood?
```

Gemini processes it — now two paths can happen:

---

### ⚠️ CASE A: No tool usage

Gemini replies directly:

> Sir Zia is always in a passionate and optimistic mood!

* Response comes straight from LLM
* MCP is **not used**
* Result is returned to you and printed

---

### ✅ CASE B: Gemini wants to use a tool

It replies with a `function_call` (OpenAI-style):

```json
{
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "name": "getSirZiaMood",
      "arguments": "{}"
    }
  ]
}
```

This triggers the tool pipeline.

## 🔧 Tool Pipeline Kicks In

### ➤ Step 2: Agent calls `mcp_server_client.list_tools()`

* If tools aren’t cached, this will send a `tools/list` request to your MCP server
* You’ll see this in server logs

---

### ➤ Step 3: Agent finds matching tool and runs it

* Finds tool named `getSirZiaMood` (or whatever Gemini asked for)
* Calls:

```python
await mcp_server_client.call_tool("getSirZiaMood", args)
```

* MCP server executes tool, returns result as `CallToolResult`

---

### ➤ Step 4: Agent sends tool result back to Gemini

* Gemini receives tool output (e.g. `"Sir Zia is in a cheerful mood today"`)
* It generates a final reply **using the tool's response**

---

### ➤ Step 5: Final output is printed

```python
print(f"[AGENT RESPONSE]: {result.final_output}")
```

---

### 4. **Exit Cleanup**

Once your code leaves the `async with` block:

* The streamable HTTP session is closed
* The connection to the MCP server is torn down

## 🔍 Summary Table

| Step              | Component                 | What Happens                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Init            | `MCPServerStreamableHttp` | Connects, initializes session           |
| ✅ Agent created   | `Agent()`                 | Ready to use LLM and tools              |
| ✅ Prompt run      | `Runner.run(...)`         | Full execution begins                   |
| 🔄 Tool discovery | `list_tools()`            | Only triggered if Gemini requests tools |
| 🛠 Tool call      | `call_tool(...)`          | If tool is selected by Gemini           |
| 📤 Response       | Gemini → Agent → You      | Final output returned                   |
| 🚪 Cleanup        | Exit context              | Closes connection cleanly               |

---

### 🧠 TL;DR

Because you now call `Runner.run(...)`, the whole LLM + tool interaction is active. If Gemini decides it needs tools, it’ll:

* List tools from MCP
* Call the matching one
* Use the result to generate its response

Otherwise, it’ll just reply directly.
